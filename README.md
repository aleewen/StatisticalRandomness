# StatisticalRandomness
Demonstration of basic stochastic processes and the effect of variance (drag).

01 Binomial Martingale:
This is a coin flip game where you earn $1 for every heads and lose -$1 for every tails. We can now graph the random walk of the results over many iterations.

02 Gaussian Random Walk:
This is another random walk where each forward-step is equal to the return of a Normal Distribution.

03 Trading Strategy Analysis:
This is simulating results of a trading strategy with a Binomial outcome, with a 50% probability of success and winners being 1.2x larger than the losers. Here we can see and plot the effect of variance on a working trading strategy and how it is still possible to go bankrupt due to the effect of randomness, chance, and variance (drag).
